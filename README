Description
===========

Installs and configures rsyslog for [Loggly](http://www.loggly.com). Makes use of user-provided lists of files and/or directories to create the appropriate rsyslog configuration file.

Requirements
============

Platform
--------

This should work on any linux platform that has rsyslog installed. It has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

Attributes
==========

* `node['loggly']['token']` - Your Loggly customer token (required).
* `node['loggly']['dashboard_url']` - The URL of your Loggly (optional).
* `node['loggly']['logfiles']` - A list of individual logfiles to monitor (optional). Each logfile to be monitored is of the format:
    ```
    {

        :filename => "/var/log/filename.log",

        :tag => "tag you want for this logfile",

        :statefile => "unique-name-for-statefile"

    }
    ```
* `node['loggly']['logdirs']` - A list of directories to monitor (optional). The rsyslog.conf template will create an [imfile](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/imfile.html) block for each file ending in '.log' in that directory. Each logdir in the list is of the format:
    ```
    {

        :directory => "/var/log/directory",

        :tag => "tag for all files in this directory"

    }
    ```

Usage
=====

Include the default recipe in a run list to have rsyslog run. Include your Loggly customer token and any logfiles and directories you want to send data to loggly in the `node['loggly']` attributes. Rsyslog will restart when the specified logfiles or directories change.
